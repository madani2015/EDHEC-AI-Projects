# Machine Learning – Chapter 1 Exercises

This project was developed during my work and teaching at **EDHEC Business School** (Nice, France).  
It introduces fundamental **machine-learning concepts** such as data preprocessing, binary classification, and model evaluation using Python.

## Objectives
- Apply basic ML workflows on structured datasets  
- Perform data cleaning, normalization, and splitting  
- Train and evaluate baseline classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Relevance
Demonstrates my ability to build and explain ML pipelines — skills directly applicable to **risk-analysis** and **AI-based decision systems**.
