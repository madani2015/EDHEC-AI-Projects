    "# Exercise: Fitting a Non-Linear Function with Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will analyze a **univariate non-linear dataset** and determine the best polynomial fit for the function using model selection. You will evaluate the models based on the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. **Load the Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Read the data from the file `non_linear_data.csv`.\n",
    "   - The dataset contains two columns:\n",
    "     - `x`: The independent variable.\n",
    "     - `y`: The dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualize the Data**:\n",
    "   - Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Split the Data**:\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into three sets: **training (60%)**, **validation (20%)**, and **test (20%)**.\n",
    "   - Use the training set to train models, the validation set for model selection, and the test set for final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fit Polynomial Models**:\n",
    "   - For each degree \\( d \\) in \\( \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\} \\), fit a polynomial regression model:\n",
    "     - Generate polynomial features up to degree \\( d \\).\n",
    "     - Fit the model on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluate Models**:\n",
    "   - For each polynomial degree:\n",
    "     - Compute the **MSE** on the training and validation sets.\n",
    "     - Store the results for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Selection**:\n",
    "   - Identify the degree of the polynomial that results in the lowest **MSE** on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Test the Best Model**:\n",
    "   - Use the test set to evaluate the performance of the selected model.\n",
    "   - Compute the **MSE** on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Visualize the Results**:\n",
    "   - Plot the original data and the predictions of the best-fitting polynomial model.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Discuss the Findings**:\n",
    "   - Analyze the results and discuss how well the selected polynomial fits the data.\n",
    "   - Compare the model’s performance on the validation and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "- A scatter plot of the data (`x` vs. `y`).\n",
    "- A table showing the MSE for training and validation sets for polynomial degrees 1 to 10.\n",
    "- The degree of the best-fitting polynomial based on validation MSE.\n",
    "- The MSE on the test set for the best model.\n",
    "- A plot showing the data points and the fitted polynomial curve for the best model.\n",
    "- A short discussion of the findings.\n"
