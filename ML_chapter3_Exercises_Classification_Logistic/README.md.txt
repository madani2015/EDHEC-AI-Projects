# Machine Learning – Chapter 3: Classification and Logistic Regression

This project was developed during my work and teaching at **EDHEC Business School** (Nice, France).  
It focuses on **classification algorithms**, particularly **logistic regression**, applied to real-world datasets from Kaggle.  
The exercises explore supervised classification, model evaluation, and interpretation of predictive factors in socio-economic, medical, and quality-assessment contexts.

## 📘 Overview

The notebook combines theoretical and practical components:

- Binary and multiclass **classification** concepts  
- The mathematics of **logistic regression** and the **cross-entropy loss**  
- Performance evaluation using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC curves**  
- Hands-on implementation of logistic-regression models with real datasets  

Through three case studies—**Titanic Survival**, **Heart Disease Prediction**, and **Wine Quality Classification**—the project demonstrates how data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation connect theory to applied data-driven insights.

### 1️⃣ Titanic Survival Analysis  
Predict passenger survival using socio-economic and demographic variables.  
Key tasks:
- Handle missing data and categorical encoding  
- Train logistic-regression model  
- Evaluate with confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Interpret coefficients (gender, age, class, fare)

### 2️⃣ Heart Disease Prediction  
Apply logistic regression on the *Heart Disease UCI* dataset to identify medical risk indicators.  
Key tasks:
- Clean and normalize medical features  
- Train/test split and model training  
- Compute ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity
