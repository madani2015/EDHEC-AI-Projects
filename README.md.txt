# EDHEC AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning and AI projects** developed as part of my work and teaching at **EDHEC Business School (Nice, France)**.  
The projects explore fundamental and advanced topics in **data analysis**, **regression**, **classification**, **model selection**, and **AI explainability**.
